    <title>Forge Breadcrumb Plugins - Release Notes</title>
  </properties>
  <body>
    <section name="Release Notes">
      <subsection name="1.02.02">
        <ul>
          <li>Better extendibility of the BreadcrumbProvider.</li>
          <li>Added JavaDoc, removing IDE warnings</li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="1.02.01">
        <ul>
          <li>Use bean#getLocalizedName instead of bean#getName when creating a breadcrumb
            item from a hippobean.</li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="1.02.00">
        <ul>
          <li>Breadcrumb plugin now uses hst tag 2.22.00.</li>
          <li>Fixed double item: if a menuitem directly linked to a document, both the
            menuitem and the document itself were added.</li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="1.01.02">
        <ul>
          <li>Possibility to set a flag 'addTrailingDocumentOnly' that changes behaviour
            of the breadcrumb provider: it does not look at path between current document
            and deepest expanded menu item but just adds the document.</li>
          <li>Add a fallback determination of the path between current document and deepest
            expanded menu item by looking at path information instead of bean ancestors,
            applicable for faceted navigation on a menu item.</li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="1.01.01">
        <ul>
          <li>Support to configure multiple menus to base the breadcrumb on. The component
            parameter 'breadcrumb-menu' is renamed to 'breadcrumb-menus', a comma
            separated list, defaulting to a list with single item 'main'.</li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="1.01.00">
        <ul>
          <li>A breadcrumb structure is constructed by determining the deepest expanded item
            from a menu for the first part and from the resolved sitemap item belonging to
            the current request for the trailing part.
            The breadcrumb is put on the request by attribute name 'breadcrumb' so a view
            can access it.</li>
          <li>The menu name is configurable by component parameter 'breadcrumb-menu' and
            defaults to 'main'.</li>
          <li>A separator is configurable by component parameter 'breadcrumb-separator' and
            defaults to 'Â»'.</li>
        </ul>
      </subsection>
