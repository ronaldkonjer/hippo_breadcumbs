Hippo Forge Breadcrumb Plugin Release Notes
===========================================

Release 1.02.01
------------------------
- Use bean#getLocalizedName instead of bean#getName when creating a breadcrumb
  item from a hippobean.


Release 1.02.00
------------------------
- Breadcrumb plugin now uses hst tag 2.22.00.
- Fixed double item: if a menuitem directly linked to a document, both the
  menuitem and the document itself were added.


Release 1.01.02
---------------
- Possibility to set a flag 'addTrailingDocumentOnly' that changes behaviour
  of the breadcrumb provider: it does not look at path between current document
  and deepest expanded menu item but just adds the document.
- Add a fallback determination of the path between current document and deepest
  expanded menu item by looking at path information instead of bean ancestors,
  applicable for faceted navigation on a menu item.


Release 1.01.01
---------------
- Support to configure multiple menus to base the breadcrumb on. The component
  parameter 'breadcrumb-menu' is renamed to 'breadcrumb-menus', a comma
  separated list, defaulting to a list with single item 'main'.


Release 1.01.00
---------------
A breadcrumb structure is constructed by determining the deepest expanded item
from a menu for the first part and from the resolved sitemap item belonging to
the current request for the trailing part.
The breadcrumb is put on the request by attribute name 'breadcrumb' so a view
can access it.

- The menu name is configurable by component parameter 'breadcrumb-menu' and
  defaults to 'main'.
- A separator is configurable by component parameter 'breadcrumb-separator' and
  defaults to 'Â»'.
